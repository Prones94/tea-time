        Our founder grew up in a poor farm village in Malaysia. To earn
        money for his family, he sold tea leaves before and after school at
        his local market, having to leave extremely early and leaving late.
        Eventually, he earned enough money to go to business school and once
        earning his degree, he stayed in the tea business and now searches
        for the best tea leaves and products for people to drink.
